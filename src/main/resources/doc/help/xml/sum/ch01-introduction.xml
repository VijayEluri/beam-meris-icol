        <para>In MERIS images an increase in the radiances, especially in the near infrared bands, can often be
            observed over water and in the vicinity of vegetated coasts. The affected area can extend over
            10km or even more. This increase is not (always) related to an increase in the aerosol optical
            depth but is caused by the so-called adjacency effect. This effect results when photons are reflected
            and scattered towards the sensor and where a substantial contrast exits between the target
            and its surrounding. During processing of such measurements the correction schemes need to take
            this effect into account, otherwise the increased radiance is erroneously associated with other
            physical processes, and the derived geophysical quantities have an increased error.

        <para>Observations over waters near to land surfaces, both for coastal and inland waters, are affected
            because of the large contrast in the red and infrared part of the spectrum, where water is almost
            black and vegetated areas are very bright. The effect is easier to illustrate in coastal waters because
            it decreases from coastline to off-shore. This effect can best be studied in MERIS Full Resolution
            images, but even in reduced resolution the adjacency effect can also clearly be seen.

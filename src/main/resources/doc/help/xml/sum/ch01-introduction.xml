        <para>In images retrieved from spectrometers such as MERIS, an increase in the radiances,
            especially in the near infrared bands, can often be
            observed over water and in the vicinity of vegetated coasts. The affected area can extend over
            10km or even more. This increase is not (always) related to an increase in the aerosol optical
            depth but is caused by the so-called adjacency effect. This effect results when photons are reflected
            and scattered towards the sensor and where a substantial contrast exits between the target
            and its surrounding. During processing of such measurements the correction schemes need to take
            this effect into account, otherwise the increased radiance is erroneously associated with other
            physical processes, and the derived geophysical quantities have an increased error.
        </para>

        <para>Observations over waters near to land surfaces, both for coastal and inland waters, are affected
            because of the large contrast in the red and infrared part of the spectrum, where water is almost
            black and vegetated areas are very bright. The effect is easier to illustrate in coastal waters because
            it decreases from coastline to off-shore. This effect can best be studied in MERIS Full Resolution
            images, but even in reduced resolution the adjacency effect can also clearly be seen.
        </para>

        <para>
            In order to build up a reliable tool for the correction of the adjacency effect, the ICOL (= Improve
            Contrast over Ocean and Land) prototype processor was developed as BEAM plugin. Although this prototype (ICOL1.0) has
            proven  to retrieve results as expected from theory, it has some well-known limitations:

                    Restricted to coastal areas over water (although the AE is known to exist as well over land)

                    Restriction to case 1 waters

                <listitem>
                    No proper handling of clouds and sea ice

                <listitem>
                    Restricted to application on MERIS data only

                    Slow processing
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            To overcome these limitations and to be able to apply the AE correction within operational processing
            chains, an improved BEAM plugin (ICOL+) has been developed. With this processor, the AE correction is applicable
            anywhere over ocean as well as over land and considers case 2 waters, clouds and sea ice. An improved
            convolution scheme (the core mathematical part of the AE corection) has been integrated to significantly
            speed up the processor. Moreover, it is possible with ICOL+ to apply the AE correction on Landsat TM data.
            This feature mainly serves as a demonstration for the general portability of the AE correction scheme
            to other instruments within future projects (e.g. related to the Sentinel missions). However, the full
            correction scheme has been implemented as for MERIS and shown to provide results as expected.
